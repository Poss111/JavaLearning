# JavaLearning
## Exercise One
#### Basics Learned:

    1. Main Method
    2. System.out.println & System.out.print
    2. Primitive Types (int, boolean)
    3. Conditionals (if, else if, else)
   
#### Assignment
    
     Create three seperate if, else if, and else Conditionals with each having a different 
     System.out.println Statement in them. Then, using the Conditional operations, make
     the first if set hit the if Statement, make the second set hit the else if statement,
     and make the third set hit the else statement.
## Exercise Two
#### Basics Learned:
    
    1. doubles
    2. Order of Operations
    3. Assigning values
    4. Combining Computations with Conditionals
    
#### Assignment

    Create a computation to compute the area of a Square given an
    int variable named width and a int variable named height. Once you have the
    area of the square, save the output value to an int variable named
    areaOfSquare and print this variable out saying "The Area of the Square is ::
    <givenAreaOfSquareVariable>" . Then use the area variable to see if it is a
    multiple of 6. If it is a multiple of 2, print out "This Area of the Square is
    divisible by 6." else "This Area of the Square is not divisible by 6." Hint ::
    Use the operation to give remainders. Estimated time :: 10 min.
    
    Sample Output (with Input of width of 2 and height of 6):
        The Area of the Square is :: 12
        This Area of the Square is divisible by 6.
    
    Given a width of 5 and a height of 3:
        The Area of the Square is :: 15
        this Area of the Square is not divisible by 6.
